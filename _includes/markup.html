                        Not finding an available time slot for a sprinkler blowout? If it’s not going to get below say 27 or so for more than an hour or two, you can always cover the exposed (above ground pipes with a blanket and trash bag which will help delay the formation of ice inside of the exposed pipes.

                        What can you do if a freeze warning is issued and you find that there are no available sprinkler blowout appointments for the next few days? You can send me a text message and I will try to accommodate you as best I can. Voice-mail is inefficient at best – if I can answer, I will. If I do not, it probably means I’m beyond capacity – thank you for your understanding!

                        I may drain the supply side pipes (if there is a drain plug available – if this is missing, I’ll let you know and recommend what should be changed or added so that your pipes will stay intact). I’m able to hook into most non-standard setups as well as I have a variety of fittings to get the water out of your sprinkler system.
