                    <p>
                        If you had someone else winterize your system, they should have left the ball valves at 45 degrees as well as both test cocks at 45 degrees. If there is a drain cap below the PVB, it also should have been left ajar or removed and stored in a safe place for the Winter. If the ball valves/test cocks were left all the way open or all the way closed, there may be damage from the water left in those valves… it’s easy to spot the ruptures or use your finger to feel for them if they are out of sight.

                        The Pressure Vacuum Breaker device must first be inspected to check for freeze damage.

                    <p>
                        Make sure that the water to the system is off at the shutoff valve inside the structure. Wear eye protection as pressure inside system can cause parts to act as projectiles. Check the top – bell cap – plastic or metal, if plastic and there is freeze damage – they sometimes do crack – even if there are not cracks remove the top and inspect the assembly within. If there is damage, generally, the assembly will have raised up on one side and will allow water to escape once the source is turned on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a metal cap and it is still present, remove this cap carefully and inspect poppet assembly for cracks. If no damage is found proceed to check the two ball valves for ruptures – usually they can been seen on the opposite side of the control handle. No damage found, proceed, note – all advice offered on this site is without warranty and or liability – use at your own risk.

                    <h2>Startup or charging method:</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        To startup your sprinkler system, use the following procedures:
                    </p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Ensure that the main shut-off valve is in the OFF position.</li>
                       <li>Close all inlet and outlet drain valves on the system. Close inlet and outlet shut-off valves on backflow prevention assembly and all testcocks.</li>
                       <li>
                        Important: Turn on water supply <strong>slowly</strong>. Inspect PVB assembly for leaks before sending water to the sprinkler manifold. <strong>Slowly</strong> allow water into the PVB assembly via first control valve nearest to the source of the water. Next, <strong>slowly</strong> open the next control valve downstream – check for leaks in the PVB. Even if you have had your system winterized properly, the poppet assembly could fail if the full force of the water pressure is released too quickly as they are generally made of plastic.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                        Leave all drain valves and test cocks closed.

                    <h2>Copper Theft and Denver Pressure Vacuum Breakers</h2>
                    <p>
                        The price of copper has gone up steadily over recent months and the rate of theft for pressure vacuum breakers is also on the rise. There are at least two methods to help secure your Pressure Vacuum Breaker. The unit is at most risk just after the sprinkler system has been winterized in the fall… the criminals know that there is no water supply and thus, makes it much easier for them to abscond with your items without being noticed.

                            Install these and then remove the PVB completely during the winter, keep in your garage:
                       </li>
                       <li>
                            Get an enclosure and have it installed around your PVB – an expensive option.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                            Obscure your exposed copper pipes with a shrub, bucket, or anything else that might serve as camouflage.
